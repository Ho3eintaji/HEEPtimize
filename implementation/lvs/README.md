To run LVS, 

first Innovus `export_design` script generates the source netlist to compare against layout in Innvous as:

`write_netlist -exclude_leaf_cells -phys ../../implementation/lvs/netlist_lvs.v`

Further, it copies the gds into this folder for further processing.

Then, to generate the verilog model use by v2lvs, Innovus creates the `stubs` netlist
with the leaf cells, which is different than the one used for `LVS`:

`write_netlist -phys ../../implementation/lvs/netlist_lvs_stubs.v`

To run LVS

```
make lvs
```

The make target first executes the script create_stubs.py which iterates over the `netlist_lvs_stubs.v` netlist, and for each module, it cheks whether that module it is contained in the `verilog.inc` file, 
and if so, it creates the stub verilog file in the `verilog_stubs` folder.

The script also creates the `verilog.stub.inc` folder, which is inteded to be used by v2lvs.

Next, `create_v2lvs_script.py` is executed to add missing connectivity when converting the verilog netlist to spice. Once this is done the spice netlist is generated by executing `source v2lvs.sh`. This script first patch an error in the FLL cdl file, then it creates the source SPICE netlist by calling `calibre v2lvs` in interaction mode running the script `v2lvs.tcl`.

Finally calibre is executed to compare the layout against the netlist.

To show the result database run the following make target:

```
make results
